# Chunk Loader

A simple Minecraft mod that adds a new block: Chunk Loader.

While powered, this block forceloads a 3x3 area around it. This behaves same as a portal chunk loader, except in only a single dimension!

(Requires Fabric API)

## Warnings

1. This mod is in alpha state currently. Do not use this in any playthrough. Only use for testing!

2. The block is available only via commands or the creative inventory. It cannot be obtained in survival (this will change in the future).

3. Avoid using the `/forceload` command as it may conflict with the mod.

4. Game crashes may desync the mod's data and cause unexpected issues.
